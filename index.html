Hi, my name is Marvin Daniel S. Dimaano, you can call me Marvs or Marvin. I live in Imus, Cavite. Since today is the first day of class and it's really early in the morning, I am feeling a little sleepy. 
During the summer this is time where I'm just preparing to go to sleep so my body haven't adjusted to the new schedule yet.
<br>
For the summer, I feel like I wasted most of my time, I just spent time playing games, browse the internet, watch movies. 
I didn't really used the time to learn any new skill or at least improve the things I learned during my first year of college.
<br>
I really don't like talking about my feelings, I like to keep things to myself.
I don't really like sharing with anyone unless it's someone I'm comfortable with.
<br>
My expectation for this subject is how can it be used or relate to the previous programming languages we have learned in the previous year.
